Explaining Javascript with Javascript

This project is meant to explain javascript through code examples and comments.  
Javascript is not meant to be merely used, it is very different from Object Oriented Languages and should be understood from the core up in order to avoid painful bugs.

## ES5
Unfortunately due to browser support and the fact that most apps needs to support relatively old browsers (of course old is relative), most projects are still written in ES5 or alternatively be converted to ES5 using Babel or something similar.  so it's important that we learn the basics of ES5 before proceeding with new subjects.

### Subjects
- [types.js](ES5/types.js)
- [conditionals.js](ES5/conditionals.js)
- [coercion.js](ES5/coercion.js)
- [equality.js](ES5/equality.js)
- [scopes.js](ES5/scopes.js)
- [truthy-falsy.js](ES5/truthy-falsy.js)
- [loops.js](ES5/loops.js)
- [arrays.js](ES5/arrays.js)
- [functions.js](ES5/functions.js)
- [hoisting.js](ES5/hoisting.js)
- [closures.js](ES5/closures.js)
- [objects.js](ES5/objects.js)
- [this.js](ES5/this.js)
- [prototypes.js](ES5/prototypes.js)
- [async.js](ES5/async.js)

## ES6
ES6 introduced new standards, it includes several solutions for old Javascript ailments such as `let`, `class`, `proxy` and so on... we will cover the most of them in the next pages.

### Subjects
- [let.js](ES6/let.js)
- [constants.js](ES6/constants.js)
- [3dot.js](ES6/3dot.js)
- [destructuring.js](ES6/destructuring.js)
- [functions.js](ES6/functions.js)
- [objects.js](ES6/objects.js)
- [templates.js](ES6/templates.js)
- [classes.js](ES6/classes.js)
- [modules.js](ES6/modules.js)
- [promises.js](ES6/promises.js)

#### Coming soon
- [symbols.js](ES6/symbols.js)
- [proxies.js](ES6/proxies.js)
- ES2017 to ES2020

## Design Patterns
Design patterns in javascript are not commonly used, but they are important to learn as they can be tricky sometimes.  

### Order
- [promises.js](Patterns/promises.js)
- [modules.js](Patterns/modules.js)
- [singleton.js](Patterns/singleton.js)
- [factory.js](Patterns/factory.js)

_More design patterns examples coming soon..._

## Performance
Javascript performance is less of an issue with the advancement of computers and browsers, but its still an issue worth taking into account while writing your code.

#### Coming soon
_Javascript performance enhancing examples_
